# InteractorMenu

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to mimic the iOS7 pull up menu, by using the customize view controller transition. The user can pull up and pull down the menu or cancel the action by gesture. 

This project also demonstrate how present a blur see-through style menu. A blur transparent menu combine with pull up menu will unify the app workflow and improve the user experience.
